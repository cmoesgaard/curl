# Documentation

You'll find a mix of various documentation in this directory and
subdirectories, using several different formats. Some of them are not ideal
for reading directly in your browser.

If you'd rather see the rendered version of the documentation, check out the
carl website's [documentation section](https://carl.se/docs/) for
general carl stuff or the [libcarl section](https://carl.se/libcarl/) for
libcarl related documentation.
