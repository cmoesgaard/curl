.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <carl/carl.h>

CARLcode carl_easy_setopt(CARL *handle, CARLOPT_SSLCERTTYPE, char *type);

PKCS#12-encoded files.

The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.

  carl_easy_setopt(carl, CARLOPT_SSLCERT, "client.pem");
  carl_easy_setopt(carl, CARLOPT_SSLCERTTYPE, "PEM");
  carl_easy_setopt(carl, CARLOPT_SSLKEY, "key.pem");
